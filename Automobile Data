--First, get an initial understanding of the data by previewing the data table and find out
  if there is any specific cleaning that needs to be done)

--Inspect the categorical columns

Note: Alternately, the distinct values- limit 10 only for all categorical data columns can be examined
     at once using the `TABLE EXPLORER` utility function.  

--Inspect the range of numerical columns

SELECT 
    MIN(length) min_range, MAX(length) max_range

    `ivory-setup-397313.vehicle.automobile`

--Inspect rows with missing values in `num_of_doors` column

SELECT

(After checking with the sales manager, who states that all Dodge gas & Mazda diesel sedans sold had four doors)

--Drop invalid rows 
(After checking with the sales manager, who says that the rows were made in error and should be removed; 
 Since there is only of them, it is save to drop them without impacting the data story)
