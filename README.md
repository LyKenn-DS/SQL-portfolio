# Shun Kenn's SQL Portfolio

Thanks for stopping by my SQL portfolio! I'm passionate about working with data, and this repository is where I bring that passion to life through SQL. You'll find a range of projects here, from foundational database operations to more advanced analytical tasks. My goal is to demonstrate how I use SQL to transform data into valuable information, and I hope you enjoy exploring them.
