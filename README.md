# SQL Portfolio

Thanks for stopping by my SQL portfolio! I'm passionate about working with data, and this repository is where I bring that passion to life through SQL. You'll find a range of projects here, from foundational database operations to more advanced analytical tasks. My goal is to demonstrate how I use SQL to transform data into valuable information, and I hope you enjoy exploring them. 

## Highlighted Projects
- **Project:** Major League Baseball Analysis
  - **Description:** This project use advanced SQL querying techniques to track how player statistics have changed over time and across different teams in the league, such as: <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; a. What schools do MLB players attend? <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; b. How much do teams spend on player salaries? <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; c. What does each player's career look like? <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; d. How do player attributes compare? <br>
The dataset contains decades worth of data including players' information, schools attended, salaries, and teams played for from multiple tables.
  - **SQL Skills Used:** Subqueries, Temporary Tables, Common Table Expression (CTEs), Window Functions, Joins, Handling Duplicate Entries and NULL values, DateTime & String Manipulation, Data Type Conversion, Pivoting, Rolling Calculations. 

- **Project: Chicago Neighborhood Quality Analysis**
  - **Description:** This project analyzes Chicago's census, crime, and school data to assess neighborhood conditions impacting educational outcomes. Specifically, it examines enrollment, safety, health, and environmental ratings to identify the risks hindering the educational progress of children and young people.
  - **SQL Skills Used:** Correlated Subqueries, Subqueries, Aggregations, Group By, Joins, Pattern Matching.

- **Data Modelling Basic:** Bub's Bigtime Baby Booties Retail Database
  - **Description:** Using MySQL Database Administration skills to design a database from scratch, which captures information about Bubs' customers, the purchases they make, his products, and his employees.
  - **SQL Skill Used:** Data Types Definition, Data Normalization.

Creating an EER diagram is helpful as it enhances our understanding on how all the data in a database is related by mapping out things like:
  - Which tables are in the database
  - Which columns exist in each table
  - The data types and constraints of the various columns
  - Primary and Foreign keys within tables
  - Relationship cardinality between tables
