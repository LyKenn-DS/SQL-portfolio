# Shun Kenn's SQL & Tableau Portfolio

Hello, are you curious about SQL? This is my remote repository, containing examples of SQL I've written for solo projects and while working through SQL on data analytic learning courses. Below are a few highlighted projects, including data visualizations I created using Tableau. Feel free to take a look around and reach out if you have any feedback or questions.  

## Highlighted Projects
- [Chicago Neighborhood Quality Analysis](https://github.com/LyKenn-DS/SQL-portfolio/blob/e76df2dc742ff397195fc250c860426ba567fdd2/Chicago%20Neighborhood%20Quality%20Analysis)<sup> *-SQL* </sup> <br>:: The census, crime, and school data of Chicago is used in this analysis with the intent to assess the enrollment, safety, health, and environmental ratings in the given neighborhood for educational purposes of the children and young people. Intentionally to create an  awareness about the potential risks that might hinder the improvement of educational outcomes. 

The hard and crucial part about SQL that's often ignored by many, is what questions to ask of the data instead of focusing on syntax writing.
