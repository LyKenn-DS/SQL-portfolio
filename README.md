# SQL Portfolio

Thanks for stopping by my SQL portfolio! I'm passionate about working with data, and this repository is where I bring that passion to life through SQL. You'll find a range of projects here, from foundational database operations to more advanced analytical tasks. My goal is to demonstrate how I use SQL to transform data into valuable information, and I hope you enjoy exploring them.

Creating an EER diagram is helpful as it enhances our understanding on how all the data in a database is related by mapping out things like:
  - Which tables are in the database
  - Which columns exist in each table
  - The data types and constraints of the various columns
  - Primary and Foreign keys within tables
  - Relationship cardinality between tables
