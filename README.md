# Shun Kenn's Excel & SQL Portfolio

Hello, are you curious about SQL? This is my remote repository, containing examples of SQL I've written for solo projects and while working through SQL on data analytic learning courses. Below are a few highlighted projects, including data visualizations I created using Tableau. Feel free to take a look around and reach out if you have any feedback or questions.  

## Highlighted Projects
- [Chicago Neighborhood Quality Analysis](https://github.com/LyKenn-DS/SQL-portfolio/blob/e76df2dc742ff397195fc250c860426ba567fdd2/Chicago%20Neighborhood%20Quality%20Analysis)<sup> *-SQL* </sup> <br>:: The census, crime, and school data of Chicago is used in this analysis with the intent to assess the enrollment, safety, health, and environmental ratings in the given neighborhood for educational purposes of the children and young people. Intentionally to create an  awareness about the potential risks that might hinder the improvement of educational outcomes. 

### Seoul 2018 Bike Rental Activity Dashboard <sup> *- [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/views/SeoulAverageBikeRentalin2018_17328735866720/Dashboard1?:language=en-GB&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)</sup>*
- **Data:** Kaggle Seoul Bike Rental Analysis 
- **Audience:** Maintenance Department
- **Purpose:** Identify the best time to run maintenance work during standard weekdays.<br>

The Seoul bike rental dataset contains the rented bicycle data collected in 2018. In order to allow smooth scheduled maintenance without disrupting the on-going services, the best time was strategically identified using data to offer valuable insights to the maintenance team. The dashboard provides a clear visual of the bike rental activity in the standard work hour, concerning various social time blocks and seasonal changes.
